> Comprehensive research compiled from successful bootstrapped launches for ReplySequence

## 1. SaaS Product Launches: First 30/60/90 Days

### Days 1-30: Validation & MVP

**Plausible Analytics Example:**
- Started as a solo project with a free beta launched on Indie Hackers
- Built in public from day one, sharing updates on blog, Indie Hackers, and Twitter
- By May 2019, had 60 beta users purely through community engagement
- [Source](https://plausible.io/blog/bootstrapping-saas)

**Senja Example:**
- Wilson Wilson learned to code and set a goal to launch within 30 days
- Started January 2, 2022, had first paying customer by June 2022 (5 months)
- Key insight: Build fast but validate before you build
- [Source](https://www.thesuccessfulprojects.com/how-two-indie-hackers-built-a-successful-micro-saas-senja-io-1m-arr/)

**Actionable Week 1-4 Tasks:**
1. Landing page + waitlist before coding features
2. Get 20+ signups to validate demand
3. Conduct 10-20 problem interviews
4. Post "building in public" updates 3-5x/week
5. Engage in niche communities daily (15-20 min minimum)

### Days 30-60: Beta Launch & Feedback Loop

**Crisp Chat Example:**
- Built first product version in 3 weeks
- Prepared high-quality landing page
- Reached first 20 users within 1 day of removing password lock
- Grew to 200 users through rapid iteration on feedback
- Early user posted them on Product Hunt, driving growth to 2,000 users

**Actionable Week 5-8 Tasks:**
1. Launch private beta to waitlist
2. Manually onboard every early user
3. Set up daily feedback collection
4. Implement most-requested features weekly
5. Track activation metrics (what makes users stick?)

### Days 60-90: Monetization & Growth

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Activation rate: What % complete core action?
- Retention: Who's still active at 10 weeks?
- Crisp found 51% retention when users installed the widget, so they doubled down on that conversion step

## 2. Product Hunt Launch: Best Practices

### Timing

- **Best time:** 12:01am PST (gives full 24 hours of visibility)
- **Best days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday for maximum traffic
- **Alternative:** Weekends have 15% more "Visit" clicks due to less competition
- [Source](https://www.marketingideas.com/p/how-to-successfully-launch-on-product)

### Preparation Checklist (2-4 Weeks Before)

**Week 4-3 Before:**
- [ ] Become active on Product Hunt (comment, upvote, engage)
- [ ] Follow other makers in your space
- [ ] Create "Coming Soon" page
- [ ] Build email list for launch day support

**Week 2-1 Before:**
- [ ] Prepare visual assets:
  - Hero banner: 1200x630 pixels
  - Logo: SVG and PNG formats
  - Feature cards: 800x600 or 600x450
- [ ] Write compelling tagline (under 60 characters)
- [ ] Prepare first comment explaining your story
- [ ] Line up 5-10 people to comment thoughtfully (NOT vote)
- [ ] Create demo video (optional but helps)

**Launch Day:**
- [ ] Post at 12:01am PST
- [ ] Share announcement to your email list immediately
- [ ] Respond to EVERY comment within 30 minutes
- [ ] Post on Twitter/X with link
- [ ] Avoid: asking for upvotes, voting rings, Twitter "please upvote" asks

### Key Insight
> "One of the biggest mistakes is showing up on Product Hunt for the first time on launch day - it's a dead giveaway. Start becoming an active member weeks in advance."

## 3. Beta to Paid Conversion Strategies

### Benchmark Conversion Rates
- **Opt-in trials (email only):** 25% conversion
- **Opt-out trials (credit card required):** 60% conversion
- [Source](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/what-is-a-free-trial-paid-conversion-rate-for-a-saas-5ca40ae619)

### Tactics That Work

**1. Discounted Beta Pricing**
- Offer beta access at reduced rate to measure commitment
- "People who pay even $1 are 10x more valuable than free signups"
- Senja used lifetime deals during beta that sold out in 4 days

**2. Close Collaboration Model**
- Work directly with beta users on feature requests
- Build relationships that make conversion natural
- When they feel invested, they want to pay

**3. Activation-Focused Onboarding**
- Identify your "magic moment" (like Crisp's widget installation)
- Double down on getting users to that moment
- Senja doubled activation by focusing onboarding on testimonial collection

**4. Grandfather Pricing**
- Reward early users with locked-in lower rates
- Creates urgency and loyalty

### Specific Conversion Tactics for ReplySequence

Given your product (meeting recordings to email drafts), focus on:
1. Get users to connect ONE calendar/Zoom account
2. Process ONE real meeting with actual draft output
3. Show the time saved with concrete metrics
4. Offer lifetime deal at $99-199 during beta

**Hacker News (Show HN)**

- Title formula: "Show HN: [Specific benefit with numbers]"
- Need 8-10 upvotes + 2-3 comments in first 30 minutes for front page

90/10 rule: 90% value contribution, 10% self-promotion

### Tier 2: Build in Public

**Twitter/X Strategy**

### Tier 3: Content Marketing

**The Plausible Playbook:**
- $0 paid advertising budget
- No affiliate program
- 100% content + community
- One blog post ("Why you should stop using Google Analytics") changed their entire trajectory

**Content Ideas for ReplySequence:**
1. "I spent 3 hours writing follow-up emails last week. Here's how I got it to 0."
2. "The hidden cost of meeting follow-ups for sales teams"
3. "Why meeting recaps don't work (and what to do instead)"

### Tier 4: Cold Outreach

**When to Use:**
- Early-stage when you need direct feedback
- A handful of personalized emails can generate leads and show traction

**How to Execute:**
1. Define ICP before sending anything
2. Research each prospect (2-3 min per email)
3. Lead with their problem, not your product
4. Aim for conversation, not immediate sale
5. Volume: 20-30 personalized emails/day is sustainable solo
